# apkworkstation

Here I brought you APKWorkstation, the ultimate tool to tinker with everything apk. With this app, you can decompile all (dex, resources) of your android application; convert dex inside the apk to jar and decompile jar to java source code. I have been eagering to make this tool ministic but powerful and elegant. The user interface is quite self-explanatory so you shouldn't have any problems using it.

I would thank VPZ for his wonderful APKStudio, as I borrowed lots of ideas (code also, this project is actually based on that one). Also thank for the authors of apktool, dex2jar, and of course the big boss--google! 

Have fun hacking!
