# apkworkstation

1. Introduction

Here I brought you APKWorkstation, the ultimate tool to tinker with everything apk. With this app, you can decompile all (dex, resources) of your android application; convert dex inside the apk to jar and decompile jar to java source code. I have been eagering to make this tool ministic but powerful and elegant. The user interface is quite self-explanatory so you shouldn't have any problems using it.

I would thank VPZ for his wonderful APKStudio, as I borrowed lots of ideas (code also, this project is actually based on that one). Also thank for the authors of apktool, dex2jar, and of course the big boss--google! 

2. Instructions

Unser the "Executable" folder you will find 3 seperate folders for Linux, Mac and Windows (there is only a folder for Mac current now as I haven't had the time to do that for Linux and Windows). Doulbe click the apkworkstation.app to launch the app, before doing any thing, first go to "Preferences" menu and set up the binaries path.

3. The verdict

Happy fun hacking!
