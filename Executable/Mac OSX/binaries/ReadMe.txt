**Welcome to APKWorkstation!**

1. Introduction

This tool is a fork of VPZ's APKStudio which focuses on apks, and apks... Yes, apks only. 

This tool extends the orginal program's capabilities by adding "Decompile dex", "Decompile Resource", "Dex to Jar" and "Show Java" functionalities. 

It's really cool to read smali alongside it's java compatriat, isn't it? 

2. Instructions
If you ever used VPZ's APKStudio, you should be ready to roll. If not, don't worry, the artifacts are quite self-explanatory and when you hover your mouse over certain items hints will pop up. 

To show java, you have to first hit the "dex2jar" button to convert the dex file inside your apk file to jar, and then decompile jar to java source code.
